This is a string manipulation library written by Nolan Ngo.


There are 9 methods in this library:
capitalize() - Capitalizes the first character of a single string.
allCaps() - Capitalizes every character in a string.
capitalizeWords() - Capitalizes the first character in every word in the string (aka titlecase).
removeExtraSpaces() - Removes uneccessary spaces in the string.
kebobCase() - Removes spaces between words and replaces them with hyphens.
snakeCase() - kebobCase with underscores instead of hyphens.
camelCase() - Combines a lowercase the first word with a capitalized second word with no spaces.
shift() - Takes the first character of a string and moves it to the back, you can specify how many letters you wish to move.
makeHashTag() - Creates seperate hashtags for all words in a string and returns an array of hashtags.
isEmpty() - Detects if a string is empty, space and multiline blank strings are also considered empty.
